<p>Table: <code>Friendship</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.
Note that user1_id &lt; user2_id.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution to report the similar friends of Leetcodify users. A user <code>x</code> and user <code>y</code> are&nbsp;similar friends if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Users <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are friends, and</li>
	<li>Users <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> listened to the same three or more different songs <strong>on the same day</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>. Note that you must return the similar pairs of friends the same way they were represented in the input (i.e., always <code>user1_id &lt; user2_id</code>).</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.</p>
