<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-scores">Rank Scores</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr><p>Table: <code>Scores</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.</li>
	<li>If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.</li>
	<li>After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>score</code> in descending order.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>
