<p>Write a solution to show the details of the invoice with the highest price. If two or more invoices have the same price, return the details of the one with the smallest <code>invoice_id</code>.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is shown in the following example.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Products table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 100   |
| 2          | 200   |
+------------+-------+
Purchases table:
+------------+------------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | quantity |
+------------+------------+----------+
| 1          | 1          | 2        |
| 3          | 2          | 1        |
| 2          | 2          | 3        |
| 2          | 1          | 4        |
| 4          | 1          | 10       |
+------------+------------+----------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | quantity | price |
+------------+----------+-------+
| 2          | 3        | 600   |
| 1          | 4        | 400   |
+------------+----------+-------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Invoice 1: price = (2 * 100) = $200
Invoice 2: price = (4 * 100) + (3 * 200) = $1000
Invoice 3: price = (1 * 200) = $200
Invoice 4: price = (10 * 100) = $1000

The highest price is $1000, and the invoices with the highest prices are 2 and 4. We return the details of the one with the smallest ID, which is invoice 2.
