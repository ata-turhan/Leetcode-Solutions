<p>The Leetcode Insurance Corp has developed an ML-driven <strong>predictive model </strong>to detect the <strong>likelihood</strong> of fraudulent claims. Consequently, they allocate their most seasoned claim adjusters to address the top <code>5%</code> of <strong>claims</strong> <strong>flagged</strong> by this model.</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the top <code>5</code> <strong>percentile</strong> of claims from <strong>each state</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by </em><code>state</code><em> in <strong>ascending</strong> order, </em><code>fraud_score</code><em> in <strong>descending</strong> order, and </em><code>policy_id</code><em> in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</em></p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Input:</strong> 
Fraud table:
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| policy_id | state      | fraud_score | 
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| 1         | California | 0.92        | 
| 2         | California | 0.68        |   
| 3         | California | 0.17        | 
| 4         | New York   | 0.94        | 
| 5         | New York   | 0.81        | 
| 6         | New York   | 0.77        |  
| 7         | Texas      | 0.98        |  
| 8         | Texas      | 0.97        | 
| 9         | Texas      | 0.96        |

| 14        | Florida    | 0.66        | 
+-----------+------------+-------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| policy_id | state      | fraud_score |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| 1         | California | 0.92        | 
| 11        | Florida    | 0.98        | 
| 4         | New York   | 0.94        | 
| 7         | Texas      | 0.98        |  
+-----------+------------+-------------+
<strong>Explanation</strong>
- For the state of California, only policy ID 1, with a fraud score of 0.92, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state.
- For the state of Florida, only policy ID 11, with a fraud score of 0.98, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state. 
- For the state of New York, only policy ID 4, with a fraud score of 0.94, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state. 
- For the state of Texas, only policy ID 7, with a fraud score of 0.98, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state. 
Output table is ordered by state in ascending order, fraud score in descending order, and policy ID in ascending order.
