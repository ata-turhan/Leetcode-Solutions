<p>You are implementing a page recommendation system for a social media website. Your system will <strong>recommend</strong> a page to <code>user_id</code> if the page is <strong>liked</strong> by <strong>at least one</strong> friend of <code>user_id</code> and is <strong>not liked</strong> by <code>user_id</code>.</p>

<p>Write a solution&nbsp;to find all the possible <strong>page recommendations</strong> for every user. Each recommendation should appear as a row in the result table with these columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>user_id</code>: The ID of the user that your system is making the recommendation to.</li>
	<li><code>page_id</code>: The ID of the page that will be recommended to <code>user_id</code>.</li>
	<li><code>friends_likes</code>: The number of the friends of <code>user_id</code> that like <code>page_id</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Take user 1 as an example:
  - User 1 is friends with users 2, 3, 4, and 6.
  - Recommended pages are 23 (user 2 liked it), 24 (user 3 liked it), 56 (user 3 liked it), 33 (user 6 liked it), and 77 (user 2 and user 3 liked it).
  - Note that page 88 is not recommended because user 1 already liked it.

Another example is user 6:
  - User 6 is friends with user 1.
  - User 1 only liked page 88, but user 6 already liked it. Hence, user 6 has no recommendations.

You can recommend pages for users 2, 3, 4, and 5 using a similar process.
