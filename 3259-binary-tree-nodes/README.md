<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-nodes">Binary Tree Nodes</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr><p>Table: <font face="monospace"><code>Tree</code></font></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+ 
| Column Name | Type | 
+-------------+------+ 
| N           | int  | 
| P           | int  |
+-------------+------+
N is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row includes N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find the node type of the Binary Tree. Output one of the following for each node:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Root</strong>: if the node is the root node.</li>
	<li><strong>Leaf</strong>: if the node is the leaf node.</li>
	<li><strong>Inner</strong>: if the node is neither root nor leaf node.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the result table ordered by node value in <strong>ascending order</strong></em>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Input:</strong> 
Tree table:
+---+------+
| N | P    | 
+---+------+
| 1 | 2    |
| 3 | 2    | 
| 6 | 8    | 
| 9 | 8    | 
| 2 | 5    | 
| 8 | 5    | 
| 5 | null | 
+---+------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+---+-------+
| N | Type  | 
+---+-------+
| 1 | Leaf  | 
| 2 | Inner |
| 3 | Leaf  |
| 5 | Root  |
| 6 | Leaf  |
| 8 | Inner |
| 9 | Leaf  |    
+---+-------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- Node 5 is the root node since it has no parent node.
- Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8 are leaf nodes because they don&#39;t have any child nodes.
- Nodes 2, 4, and 7 are inner nodes as they serve as parents to some of the nodes in the structure.
