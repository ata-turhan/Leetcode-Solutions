<strong>Output:</strong>

+------------+-----------+-----------+
| 31-35      | 37.84     | 62.16     |
| 26-30      | 82.26     | 17.74     |
| 21-25      | 54.31     | 45.69     |
+------------+-----------+-----------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
For age group 31-35:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 123.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 3.50, and the time spent on opening snaps is 4.50 + 1.25 = 5.75.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 3.50 + 5.75 = 9.25.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (3.50 / 9.25) * 100 = 37.84, and the opening snap percentage will be (5.75 / 9.25) * 100 = 62.16.
For age group 26-30: 
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 456. 
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 5.67 + 8.24 = 13.91, and the time spent on opening snaps is 3.00. 
  - The overall time spent by this user is 13.91 + 3.00 = 16.91. 
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (13.91 / 16.91) * 100 = 82.26, and the opening snap percentage will be (3.00 / 16.91) * 100 = 17.74.
For age group 21-25: 
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 789. 
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 6.24, and the time spent on opening snaps is 5.25. 
  - The overall time spent by this user is 6.24 + 5.25 = 11.49. 
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (6.24 / 11.49) * 100 = 54.31, and the opening snap percentage will be (5.25 / 11.49) * 100 = 45.69.
All percentages in output table rounded to the two decimal places.
