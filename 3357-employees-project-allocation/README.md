employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key (reference column) to <code>Employee</code> table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id and the workload of the project.

<strong>Input:</strong> 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| project_id  | employee_id | workload |
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| 1           | 1           |  45      |
| 1           | 2           |  90      | 
| 2           | 3           |  12      |
| 2           | 4           |  68      |

Employees table:
+-------------+--------+------+
| employee_id | name   | team |
+-------------+--------+------+
| 1           | Khaled | A    |
| 2           | Ali    | B    |
| 3           | John   | B    |

| 2           | 1          | Ali           | 90               | 
| 4           | 2          | Doe           | 68               | 
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- Employee with ID 1 has a project workload of 45 and belongs to Team A, where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does not exceed the team&#39;s average workload, he will be excluded.
- Employee with ID 2 has a project workload of 90 and belongs to Team B, where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does exceed the team&#39;s average workload, he will be included.
- Employee with ID 3 has a project workload of 12 and belongs to Team B, where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does not exceed the team&#39;s average workload, he will be excluded.
- Employee with ID 4 has a project workload of 68 and belongs to Team A, where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does exceed the team&#39;s average workload, he will be included.
Result table orderd by employee_id, project_id in ascending order.
