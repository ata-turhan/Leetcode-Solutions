<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
In March, the company&#39;s average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...
The average salary for department &#39;1&#39; is 9000, which is the salary of employee_id &#39;1&#39; since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is &#39;higher&#39; since 9000 &gt; 8333.33 obviously.
The average salary of department &#39;2&#39; is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of employee_id &#39;2&#39; and &#39;3&#39;. So the comparison result is &#39;lower&#39; since 8000 &lt; 8333.33.

With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is &#39;same&#39; since both the department &#39;1&#39; and &#39;2&#39; have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.
