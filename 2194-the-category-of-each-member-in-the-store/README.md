<p>A store wants to categorize its members. There are three tiers:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>&quot;Diamond&quot;</strong>: if the conversion rate is <strong>greater than or equal to</strong> <code>80</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>&quot;Gold&quot;</strong>: if the conversion rate is <strong>greater than or equal to</strong> <code>50</code> and less than <code>80</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>&quot;Silver&quot;</strong>: if the conversion rate is <strong>less than</strong> <code>50</code>.</li>
	<li><strong>&quot;Bronze&quot;</strong>: if the member never visited the store.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>conversion rate</strong> of a member is <code>(100 * total number of purchases for the member) / total number of visits for the member</code>.</p>

<p>Write a solution to report the id, the name, and the category of each member.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- User Narihan with id = 1 did not make any visits to the store. She gets a Bronze category.
- User Winston with id = 3 visited the store one time and did not purchase anything. The conversion rate = (100 * 0) / 1 = 0. He gets a Silver category.
- User Hercy with id = 8 visited the store one time and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 1 = 1. He gets a Diamond category.
- User Alice with id = 9 visited the store two times and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 2 = 50. She gets a Gold category.
- User Bob with id = 11 visited the store three times and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 3 = 33.33. He gets a Silver category.
