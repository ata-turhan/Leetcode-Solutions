<strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;
There are total 9 users on the platform.
- User &quot;1&quot; has friendships with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 1 would be calculated as (5/9) * 100 = 55.56.
- User &quot;2&quot; has friendships with 1, 6 and 7. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 2 would be calculated as (3/9) * 100 = 33.33.
- User &quot;3&quot; has friendships with 1, 8 and 9. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 3 would be calculated as (3/9) * 100 = 33.33.
- User &quot;4&quot; has friendships with 1. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 4 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User &quot;5&quot; has friendships with 1. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 5 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User &quot;6&quot; has friendships with 1 and 2. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 6 would be calculated as (2/9) * 100 = 22.22.
- User &quot;7&quot; has friendships with 2. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 7 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User &quot;8&quot; has friendships with 3. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 8 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User &quot;9&quot; has friendships with 3. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 9 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
user1 is sorted in ascending order.
