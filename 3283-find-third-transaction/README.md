(user_id, transaction_date) is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains user_id, spend, and transaction_date.
</pre>

<p>Write a solution to find the <strong>third transaction </strong>(if they have at least three transactions) of every user, where the <strong>spending</strong> on the preceding <strong>two transactions</strong> is <strong>lower</strong> than the spending on the <strong>third</strong> transaction.</p>

<p>Return <em>the result table by </em><code>user_id</code><em> in <strong>ascending</strong> order</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

| user_id | third_transaction_spend | third_transaction_date | 
+---------+-------------------------+------------------------+

<strong>Explanation</strong>
- For user_id 1, their third transaction occurred on 2023-11-18 at 13:49:42 with an amount of $65.56, surpassing the expenditures of the previous two transactions which were $7.44 on 2023-11-02 at 12:15:23 and $49.78 on 2023-11-12 at 00:13:46. Thus, this third transaction will be included in the output table.
- user_id 2 only has a total of 2 transactions, so there isn&#39;t a third transaction to consider.
- For user_id 3, the amount of $7.0 for their third transaction is less than that of the preceding two transactions, so it won&#39;t be included.
Output table is ordered by user_id in ascending order.
