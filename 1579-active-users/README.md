This table may contain duplicate rows.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Active users</strong> are those who logged in to their accounts for five or more consecutive days.</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the id and the name of <strong>active users</strong>.</p>

<p>Return the result table <strong>ordered</strong> by <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> Could you write a general solution if the active users are those who logged in to their accounts for <code>n</code> or more consecutive days?</p>
